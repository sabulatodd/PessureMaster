A few more approaches:

let array = ["1", "2", "3"]
You can use forEach with trailing closure syntax:

array.forEach { item in
print(item)
}
You can use the $0 shorthand:

array.forEach {
print($0)
}
And if you need the indexes, you can use enumerate():

array.enumerate().forEach { itemTuple in
print("\(itemTuple.element) is at index \(itemTuple.index)")
